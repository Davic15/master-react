### Section 20 - Hook useRef
    - Object of reference of the DOM.
    - While the component is load, that reference is loaded.

    - One way to access to values inside the form.
        - With the e.target.name.value.
        - Adding a name to each input.
    
    - Other way to do it is using useRef

    - When the element is modified, the current property is updated.

    - We can save information that can change in any moment.
