### Section 12 - Hook useEffect
    - In any change we can use useEffect hook.
    - When we load a component we can use useEffect.
    - To use it once we need to add a second paramenter [], just when we load the component.
    - useEffect always split.
    - We can use to see if the component is unmounted.
